# Role 3 – Evaluation, Metrics, and Visualization

This folder contains the deliverables for **Role 3** of the Bitcoin Forecasting Project.  
Role 3 is responsible for evaluating model performance using predictions from Role 2 and producing final metrics, tables, and visualizations.

---

## 📌 Responsibilities

- Load `predictions.csv` generated by Role 2
- Compute all required evaluation metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
  - Directional Accuracy (DA)
- Create:
  - A final comparison table of all models
  - Visualizations for each metric
  - Actual vs. predicted time-series plots
- Export metrics and graphics for the final presentation

---

## 📁 Files in This Folder

- `role3_evaluation_notebook.ipynb`  
  Main evaluation notebook. Computes metrics, generates tables, and produces plots.

- `metrics_summary.csv`  
  Final metrics table for all models combined across all folds.

- `plots/`  
  Contains exported figures used in the final project report/presentation.

## ▶️ Running the Evaluation Notebook

1. Ensure you have the virtual environment activated:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
