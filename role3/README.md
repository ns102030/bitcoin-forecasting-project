# Role 3 – Evaluation, Metrics, and Visualization

This folder contains all deliverables for **Role 3** of the Bitcoin Forecasting Project.  
Role 3 evaluates model performance and produces the final metrics and visualizations.

---

## 📌 Responsibilities

- Load `predictions.csv` from Role 2  
- Compute evaluation metrics:  
  - RMSE  
  - MAE  
  - MAPE  
  - R²  
  - Directional Accuracy (DA)  
- Create model comparison tables  
- Generate plots, including:  
  - Actual vs Predicted  
  - RMSE  
  - MAE  
  - MAPE  
  - R²  
  - DA  
- Export all metrics and figures for inclusion in the final report and presentation  

---

## 📁 Folder Contents

- **`bitcoin_model_evaluation.ipynb`**  
  Notebook that computes metrics and generates visualizations.

- **`metrics_summary.csv`**  
  Final combined metrics table for all models.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  List of packages needed to run the script.
  
- **`predictions.csv`**  
  Data required to run the script.
---

## ▶️ How to Use

Run the evaluation notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook bitcoin_model_evaluation.ipynb

### Load predictions inside the notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("predictions.csv")
df.head()
```

---

## 🔗 Input Required From Role 2

Role 3 requires:

- **`predictions.csv`** — the output file generated by Role 2 containing actuals, predictions, and `Fold_ID`.

---

## 📝 Notes

All metrics and charts in the final project presentation come from this role.  
Incorrect or misaligned predictions from Role 2 may result in inaccurate evaluation metrics.
